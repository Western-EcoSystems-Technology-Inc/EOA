Description: Evidence of Absence software (EoA) is a user-friendly
    application for estimating bird and bat fatalities at wind farms and
    designing search protocols. The software is particularly useful in
    addressing whether the number of fatalities has exceeded a given
    threshold and what search parameters are needed to give assurance that
    thresholds were not exceeded. The software is applicable even when
    zero carcasses have been found in searches.
